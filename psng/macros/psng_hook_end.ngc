; You should NOT edit this file directly, instead, you should copy this file
; from the psng/macros folder, to the macros folder and edit the copy.

; The #1 variable will be set to the name of the macro being hooked. For
; example, when o<psng_manual_change> is called, #1 will be set to the
; value "psng_manual_change".
